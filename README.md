# BearMaps on Quilt
This tutorial will walk you through how to run BearMaps with
[Quilt](http://quilt.io/). Right now, your application is only accessible from
your laptop, but by the end of this tutorial, your BearMaps application will be
hosted in the [Amazon AWS cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/), where it is
accessible to you, your friends, parents, pets, and the rest of the world.

## Quilt
Before we dive into it, you might want to know what [Quilt](http://quilt.io) is.
[Quilt](http://quilt.io) is a research project here at UC Berkeley and is fueled
in part by lots of CS61B spirit in form of current TAs Matt and Vivian, and
previous TAs Kay and Luise. Quilt's goal is to be the easiest way to deploy
applications -- just like BearMaps -- in the cloud. We, the Quilt team, will be
on Piazza to help out if you run into any issues!

It would be a big help for us if you star the [Quilt project on
GitHub](http://github.com/quilt/quilt). You will get absolutely no
notifications, emails, or other stuff from us by doing it - it is just like
"liking" a photo on Facebook. By staring the project, you’re letting others on
GitHub know they should check it out - and maybe one day it will be cool to say
you were one of the intitial users. Who knows? You can star the project by
pressing the button in the top right corner that looks like this:

To thank you for your time, you can come to 420 Soda and pick up a limited
edition, soon-to-be collector's item sticker of Josh Hug in a trash can:

The stickers are in the mail, but will be here soon!

## Deploying BearMaps
We have made everything ready for you. You just need to set up an AWS account,
install Quilt, and finally change a single line of code the Quilt BearMaps spec
before your app is live.

The instructions assume that Windows users use GitBash. If you don't, just make
sure to change the directory paths accordingly.

### AWS Account
Follow the below instructions to set up your AWS account. You'll be using AWS's
**free** tier, so it won't cost you a penny. AWS is super widely used, so
chances are that you either already have an account or will need one in your
future CS career. If you already have an account, just skip step 1.

1.  Sign up for the AWS Free Tier on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/free-tier/free_np/).
They will ask for a debit/credit card, but don't worry, they won't charge you
anything for just running BearMaps.
2. Sign in to the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
3. In the top right corner, click your name and then `My Security Credentials`.
In the pop up window, click `Continue to Security Credentials`.
4. Click `Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)` and then `Create
New Access Key` to download your AWS key and key ID.
5. Put the key and ID in a file called `~/.aws/credentials`. This credentials
file must be formatted *exactly* like this:

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=<YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key=<YOUR_AWS_KEY>
```

Your AWS account is now ready! You only have to do this setup once. Next time
you want to run BearMaps or another application on Quilt, you can skip this step
and the next and jump straight to [Run BearMaps](#run-bearmaps).

### Installing Quilt
Go to the [releases page on Quilt’s github](https://github.com/quilt/quilt/releases).

#### Windows
1. Click on `quilt_windows.zip` to install Quilt.
2. In your terminal, navigate to the location of `quilt_windows.zip` (this will
be `~\Downloads` by default, but you are free to move it), and unzip the file
with `unzip quilt_windows.zip`.

3. From the same directory, run `./quilt`. If Quilt is succesfully installed,
you should see output starting with `Usage: quilt ...`.

#### Mac and Linux
1. Click on `quilt_mac.tgz` (or `quilt_linux.tgz` if on Linux) to download
Quilt.
2. In the terminal, unzip the file with `tar -xf quilt_mac.tgz` (or
`quilt_linux.tgz`).
3. Move the Quilt binary by running `sudo mv ~/Downloads/quilt /usr/local/bin/quilt`.
If you're promted for a password, type the same password you use to log on to your
computer.
4. Run `quilt` from the terminal. Quilt is succesfully installed if the output
starts with `Usage: quilt ...`.

### Run BearMaps
The rest of the instructions are practically the same for Windows and Mac. The
only difference is that if you're on Windows, you need to use `./quilt` instead
of `quilt` and make sure you're in the directory containing `quilt.exe`.

1. We made a [Quilt specification](https://github.com/quilt/bear-maps) for you
to deploy BearMaps. You can get it by running `quilt get github.com/quilt/bear-maps`.
The code is now in `~/.quilt/github.com/quilt/bear-maps`.
2. Open the file `~/.quilt/github.com/quilt/bear-maps/main.js`. Change the
`PROJ_PATH` variable to be the path to your BearMaps code (the directory that
contains the `pom.xml` file). Use an absolute path like
`/Users/Josh/cs61b/abc/proj3` (or `C:\\Users\\Josh\\...` on Windows - notice
the **double backslashes**).
	* **Windows Users**: Replace the current BearMaps import with the import of
	`bear-maps-windows.js` in line 3.
3. Open one more terminal window. In one of them, run `quilt daemon` (it is
supposed to keep running), and in the other terminal, run `quilt run
github.com/quilt/bear-maps/main.js`.

### Accessing Your BearMaps
Quilt is now setting up your virtual machines (VMs) and container (lightweight
VM) in the Amazon AWS cloud.
You can use the command `quilt ps` to see the status of your VMs and container.
When everything is ready (after a few minutes), you should see a `running`
container in the bottom row, similar to this:

```bash
$ quilt ps
MACHINE         ROLE      PROVIDER    REGION       SIZE        PUBLIC IP         STATUS
e5b1839d2bea    Master    Amazon      us-west-1    t2.micro    52.53.161.116     connected
e2401c348c78    Worker    Amazon      us-west-1    t2.micro    54.215.234.111    connected

CONTAINER       MACHINE         COMMAND                              LABELS       STATUS     CREATED               PUBLIC IP
5380e5a57b79    e2401c348c78    luise/bear-maps-base /bin/sh -...    bear-maps    running    About a minute ago
7d5d276468d1    e2401c348c78    haproxy:1.6.4 haproxy-systemd-...    hap          running    About a minute ago    54.215.234.111:80
```

Now you can access your BearMaps application! Simply use your browser to go to
the public IP address and port shown in the `quilt ps` output - in this case
`54.215.234.111`. Yours will likely be different. Now that your BearMaps is
running in the cloud, anyone can access it in their browser using the same
IP address!

If you're wondering why the IP address is associated with the container labelled
`hap` instead of `bear-maps`, that's just because we use a service called
`HAProxy` to distribute requests across multiple instances of BearMaps. Since
you're only running a single BearMaps instance, this doesn't do much, but if
you were running more (like we do for the reference solution!) it's quite
useful.

### Stopping Quilt
When you're done enjoying your great work, run `quilt stop` to shut down the
VMs. In the terminal that's running `quilt daemon`, wait for it to say
`Successfully stopped machines` and then exit with Ctrl+c.
